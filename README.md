# DJANGO WEB DEVELOPMENT, MACHINE LEARNING + AI INTEGRATIONS

## Master practical and theoretical concepts

This full-stack web, Django and AI combination course leads you through a complete range of software skills and languages, skilling you up to be an incredibly on-demand developer. The combination of being able to create full-stack websites AND machine learning and AI models is very rare - something referred to as a unAIcorn. This is exactly what you will be able to do by the end of this course.

## Why you need this course

Whether you're looking to get into a high paying job in tech, aspiring to build a portfolio so that you can land remote contracts and work from the beach, or you're looking to grow your own tech start-up, this course will be essential to set you up with the skills and knowledge to develop you into a unAIcorn.

It won't matter if you're a complete beginner to software or a seasoned veteran. This course will fill all the gaps in between. I will be there with you through your complete learning experience.

What you will get out of this course

I will give you straightforward examples, instructions, advice, insights and resources for you to take simple steps to start coding your own programs, solving problems that inspire you and instilling the 'developer's mindset' of problem solving into you.

I don't just throw you in at the deep end - I provide you with the resources to learn and develop what you need at a pace that works for you and then help you stroll through to the finish line. Studies have shown that to learn effectively from online courses tutorials should last around ten minutes each. Therefore to maximise your learning experience all of the lectures in this course have been created around this amount of time or less.

My course integrates all of the aspects required to get you on the road becoming a successful web, software and machine learning developer. I teach and I preach, with live, practical exercises and walkthroughs throughout each of the sections.
